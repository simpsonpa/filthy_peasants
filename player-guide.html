    <h2>Rules for Level 0 Characters</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Drive It Like You Stole It</strong><br>
      Just because you might have explored a lot of dungeons in games doesn’t mean your character has! 
      Embrace the fun that comes from making deliberately poor decisions...</li>

      <li><strong>Managing the Chaos</strong><br>
      If you’re used to managing one character at a time, it can be strange to have to look after four people at once...</li>

      <li><strong>Be Fans of Your Characters</strong><br>
      Embody your characters with care and love...</li>

      <li><strong>Your Characters Don’t Have to Be Fans of Each Other</strong><br>
      This adventure is designed to introduce a play style...</li>

      <li><strong>Engage in Creative Play</strong><br>
      Your characters are incredibly weak, and they don’t have special abilities...</li>
    </ol>
