    <h2>Campaign Hook</h2>
    <p>
      The road into Steyside crosses a bridge over a slow-moving river that’s more like a thick,
      muddy ditch than an actual waterway. A narrow crack in the riverbank opens into caves that
      local children explore from time to time. Recently, travelers have complained of a foul smell
      wafting up from the opening and strange tracks in the mud. Now a merchant caravan has
      vanished, and one word sits heavy on the lips of the townsfolk—trolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villagers drew lots, and your motley crew has been selected to head into the caves and
      save anybody they can. It’s time to do what all good villagers do in a crisis—grab pitchforks,
      form a mob, and put the monsters to the blade.
