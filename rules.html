    <h2>Guidelines for Level 0 Characters</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Drive It Like You Stole It</strong><br>
      Just because you might have explored a lot of dungeons in games doesn’t mean your character has! Embrace the fun that comes from making deliberately poor decisions and seeing what happens. Your characters are expendable, and the others learn from the mistakes of those who perish.
        </li>

      <li><strong>Managing the Chaos</strong><br>
      If you’re used to managing one character at a time, it can be strange to have to look after four people at once. All of your characters explore the dungeon simultaneously, and you should inhabit their personalities as and when you see fit. It can feel a little chaotic, but you’ll soon start to discover each character’s identity. You’ll figure out who takes risks, who is likely to have insightful thoughts about the location they’re in, etc. Trust your gut and go with it.
        </li>

      <li><strong>Be Fans of Your Characters</strong><br>
      Embody your characters with care and love for who they are and who they have the potential to be. Root for them to survive and succeed. Then put them in no-win situations, see what happens, and enjoy the outcome—even if they die.
        </li>

      <li><strong>Your Characters Don’t Have to Be Fans of Each Other</strong><br>
      This adventure is designed to introduce a play style you may not have encountered much in your fifth edition games. Players won’t create a shared backstory, and character conflict is recommended. In a normal game, intercharacter conflict and betrayal often aren’t desirable. In the funnel, you are encouraged to have your level-0 characters mess with and betray each other. It’s fun to take these characters and put them at odds with one another. Can you tell that there’s a horrible trap just behind that door? Maybe one of your characters shoves another to see what happens. Create memorable moments by having your own characters interact with one another in ways that might not occur in normal play. 
      
      It creates a different dynamic between the characters who live through the funnel. The experiences your characters have at level 0 define them forever and forge a bond between the group of survivors that’s hard to replicate by writing a shared backstory. 
        </li>

      <li><strong>Engage in Creative Play</strong><br>
      Your characters are incredibly weak, and they don’t have special abilities or powerful items to help them in their adventure. They’re forced to rely on their wits and creativity— and that often means your wits and creativity.
      
      Assume that everything in the dungeon hates your characters and wants them to die. Often, the obvious solution to a problem—charging into combat, wading into deep water, etc.—is the wrong solution and ends in tragedy.
      
      As a player, try to come up with creative solutions to challenges. Ask questions about the surroundings, make use of things you find, and think around the problem. Don’t look to your character sheet for all the answers. Think about your fictional positioning and use it to get some kind of advantage in a situation (mechanical or otherwise). Get creative with your equipment and trinket!
